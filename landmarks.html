      <summary>Full description of the video</summary>
      <p>The video opens with sweeping drone footage of Baku’s skyline at sunset. The Flame Towers shimmer as sunlight reflects off their glass surfaces. A narrator begins speaking in a calm, clear voice, introducing Azerbaijan as the “Land of Fire,” describing its unique position between Europe and Asia.

As the narration continues, the scene shifts to Baku’s Old City (Icherisheher). The camera moves slowly through narrow cobbled streets lined with stone buildings, showing vendors, small cafes, and local artisans. The Maiden Tower appears, with tourists taking photos nearby.

Next, footage transitions to the Gobustan National Park, showing rocky landscapes and close-ups of ancient petroglyphs carved into stone. The narrator explains the age and significance of the carvings, while subtle traditional music plays in the background.

The video then shows Sheki Khan’s Palace, capturing its intricate stained glass windows and interior frescoes. There is a brief moment of ambient sound as the narrator pauses and birds chirp in the garden.

Following this, we see scenes of the Caucasus Mountains in winter. Skiers are shown descending snowy slopes at Tufandag Mountain Resort, with upbeat music and excited voices heard in the background. The narration resumes, emphasizing Azerbaijan’s diversity in landscapes and experiences.

The video concludes with clips of cultural events: traditional Mugham musicians, dancers in colorful costumes performing at a festival, and shots of local cuisine — including plov and dolma being served in a village setting. The narrator summarizes that Azerbaijan offers “a journey through history, hospitality, and breathtaking nature.”
